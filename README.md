RF remote controller
-------

Control device using RF remote. Uses servo motor to push on `real` remote buttons.

Uses 4 buttons from remote, 2 for connection (open/close) and 2 for actioning (on/off). The 2 buttons for `connection` are so that we open a `portal` of 30 seconds, in which you can control the servo (on/off)
